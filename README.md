# BooW-VTON
Offical code repository of “[BooW-VTON: Boosting In-the-Wild Virtual Try-On via Mask-Free Pseudo Data Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06047)”
The Training Code and demo coming soon ~

In order to conduct the same StreetVTON test as in the article, you can get the model images from the [StreetVTON](https://github.com/cuiaiyu/street-tryon-benchmark), get the clothing images from [VITON-HD](https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD), and finally use the test pairs `streetvton_test_pairs.txt` in this repo to conduct a try-on test.
